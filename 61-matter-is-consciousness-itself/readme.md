# 61. Matter is Consciousness Itself

>The world you perceive is made of consciousness; what you call ‘matter’ is consciousness itself. You are the space (*akash*) in which it moves, the time in which it lasts, the love that gives it life.

**Questioner:**&ensp;I was lucky to have holy company all my life. Is it enough for self-realisation?

**Maharaj:**&ensp;It depends what you make of it.

**Q:**&ensp;I was told that the liberating action of <span data-tippy-content="Association with the true and the wise people.">satsang</span> is automatic. Just like a river carries one to the estuary, so the subtle and silent influence of good people will take me to reälity.

**M:**&ensp;It will take you to the river, but the crossing is your own. Freedom cannot be gained nor kept without will-to-freedom. You must strive for liberation; the least you can do is uncover and remove the obstacles diligently. If you want peace you must strive for it. You will not find peace simply by keeping quiet.

**Q:**&ensp;A child just grows. He does not make plans for growth; nor has he a pattern; nor does he grow by fragments, a hand here a leg there; he grows integrally and unconsciously.

**M:**&ensp;Because he is free of imagination. You can also grow like this, but you must not indulge in forecasts and plans, born of memory and anticipation. It is one of the peculiarities of a <span data-tippy-content="The knower, especially of the higher knowledge derived from meditation; ‘closely related to the knowledge of Brahman’. (<em>jna</em>, to know; <em>jnani</em>, the knower).">jnani</span> that he is not concerned with the future. Your concern with the future is due to fear of pain and desire for pleasure; to the *jnani* all is bliss — he is happy with whatever comes.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely, there are many things that would make even a *jnani* miserable.

**M:**&ensp;A *jnani* may meet with difficulties, but they do not make him suffer. Bringing up a child from birth to maturity may seem a hard task, but to a mother the memories of hardships are a joy. There is nothing wrong with the world. What is wrong is the way you look at it. It is your own imagination that misleads you. Without imagination there is no world. Your conviction that you are conscious of a world *is* the world. The world you perceive is made of consciousness; what you call ‘matter’ is consciousness itself. You are the space (<span data-tippy-content="the void, an element of space, sky.">akash</span>) in which it moves, the time in which it lasts, the love that gives it life. Cut off imagination and attachment and what remains?

**Q:**&ensp;The world remains. I remain.

**M:**&ensp;Yes, but how different it is when you can see it as it is, not through the screen of desire and fear.

**Q:**&ensp;What are all these distinctions for — reälity and illusion, wisdom and ignorance, saint and sinner? Everyone is in search of happiness; everyone strives desperately; everyone is a <span data-tippy-content="One who practices <em>yoga</em>.">yogi</span> and his life a school of wisdom. Each learns in his own way the lessons he needs. Society approves of some, disapproves of others; there are no rules that apply everywhere and for all time.

**M:**&ensp;In my world, love is the only law. I do not ask for love, I give it. Such is my nature.

**Q:**&ensp;I see you living your life according to a pattern. You run a meditation class in the morning, lecture and have discussions regularly; twice daily there is worship (<span data-tippy-content="Worship, adoration.">puja</span>) and devotional singing (<span data-tippy-content="Devotional singing, prayer.">bhajan</span>) in the evening. You seem to adhere to the routine scrupulously.

**M:**&ensp;The worship and the singing are as I found them and I saw no reason to interfere. The general routine is according to the wishes of the people with whom I happen to live or who come to listen. They are working people with many obligations and the timing is for their convenience. Some repetitive routine is inevitable. Even animals and plants have their timetables.

**Q:**&ensp;Yes, we see a regular sequence in all life. Who maintains the order? Is there an inner ruler, who lays down laws and enforces order?

**M:**&ensp;Everything moves according to its nature. Where is the need of a policeman? Every action creates a reäction which balances and neutralises the action. Everything happens, but there is a continuous cancelling out, and in the end it is as if nothing happened.

**Q:**&ensp;Do not console me with final harmonies. The accounts tally, but the loss is mine.

**M:**&ensp;Wait and see. You may end up with a profit good enough to justify the outlays.

**Q:**&ensp;There is a long life behind me and I often wonder whether its many events took place by accident, or whether there was a plan. Was there a pattern laid down before I was born by which I had to live my life? If so, who made the plans and who enforced them? Can there be deviations and mistakes? Some say destiny is immutable and every second of life is predetermined; others say that pure accident decides everything.

**M:**&ensp;You can have it as you like. You can distinguish a pattern in your life or see merely a chain of accidents. Explanations are meant to please the mind. They need not be true. Reälity is indefinable and indescribable.

**Q:**&ensp;Sir, you are evading my question! I want to know how *you* look at it. Wherever we look we find a structure of unbelievable intelligence and beauty. How can I believe that the universe is formless and chaotic? Your world, the world in which you live, may be formless, but it need not be chaotic.

**M:**&ensp;The objective universe has structure, is orderly and beautiful. Nobody can deny it. But structure and pattern imply constraint and compulsion. My world is absolutely free; everything in it is self-determined. Therefore I keep on saying that all happens by itself. There is order in my world too, but it is not imposed from outside. It comes spontaneously and immediately because of its timelessness. Perfection is not in the future. It is *now*.

**Q:**&ensp;Does your world affect mine?

**M:**&ensp;At one point only — at the point of the *now*. It gives it momentary being, a fleeting sense of reälity. In full awareness the contact is established. It needs effortless, unself-conscious attention.

**Q:**&ensp;Is not attention an attitude of mind?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, when the mind is eager for reality, it gives attention. There is nothing wrong with your world; it is your thinking yourself to be separate from it that creates disorder. Selfishness is the source of all evil.

**Q:**&ensp;I am coming back to my question: Before I was born, did my inner self decide the details of my life, or was it entirely accidental and at the mercy of heredity and circumstances?

**M:**&ensp;Those who claim to have selected their father and mother and decided how they are going to live their next life may know for themselves. I know for myself. I was never born.

**Q:**&ensp;I see you sitting in front of me and answering my questions.

**M:**&ensp;You see the body only, which, of course, was born and will die.

**Q:**&ensp;It is the life-story of this body–mind that I am interested in. Was it laid down by you or somebody else, or did it happen accidentally?

**M:**&ensp;There is a catch in your very question. I make no distinction between the body and the universe. Each is the cause of the other; each *is* the other, in truth. But I am out of it all. When I am telling you that I was never born, why go on asking me what my preparations for the next birth were? The moment you allow your imagination to spin, it at once spins out a universe. It is not at all as you imagine and I am not bound by your imaginings.

**Q:**&ensp;It requires intelligence and energy to build and maintain a living body. Where do they come from?

**M:**&ensp;There is only imagination. The intelligence and power are all used up in your imagination. It has absorbed you so completely that you just cannot grasp how far from reality you have wandered. No doubt, imagination is richly creative. Universe within universe are built on it. Yet they are all in space and time, past and future, which just do not exist.

**Q:**&ensp;I recently read a report about a little girl who was very cruelly handled in her early childhood. She was badly mutilated and disfigured and grew up in an orphanage, completely estranged from its surroundings. This little girl was quiet and obedient, but completely indifferent. One of the nuns who was looking after the children was convinced that the girl was not mentally retarded, but merely withdrawn, irresponsive. A psychoänalyst was asked to take up the case and for two full years he would see the child once a week and try to break the wall of isolation. She was docile and well-behaved, but would give no attention to her doctor. He brought her a toy house with rooms and movable furniture and dolls representing a father, mother and their children. It brought out a response — the girl became interested. One day the old hurts revived and came to the surface. Gradually she recovered, a number of operations brought back her face and body to normal and she grew into an efficient and attractive young woman. It took the doctor more than five years, but the work was done. He was a real <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</span>! He did not put down conditions nor talk about readiness and eligibility. Without faith and without hope, out of love only, he tried and tried again.

**M:**&ensp;Yes, that is the nature of a *guru*. He will never give up. But to succeed, he must not be met with too much resistance. Doubt and disobedience necessarily delay. Given confidence and pliäbility, he can bring about a radical change in the disciple speedily. Deep insight in the *guru* and earnestness in the disciple — both are needed. Whatever was her condition, the girl in your story suffered for lack of earnestness in people. The most difficult are the intellectuals. They talk a lot, but are not serious. 

What you call realisation is a natural thing. When you are ready, your *guru* will be waiting. <span data-tippy-content="The practice which produces success, <em>siddhi</em>.">Sadhana</span> is effortless. When the relationship with your teacher is right, you grow. Above all, trust him. He cannot mislead you.

**Q:**&ensp;Even when he asks me to do something patently wrong?

**M:**&ensp;Do it. A *sanyasi* had been asked by his *guru* to marry. He obeyed and suffered bitterly. But his four children were all saints and seers, the greatest in Maharashtra. Be happy with whatever comes from your *guru* and you will grow to perfection without striving.

**Q:**&ensp;Sir, have you any wants or wishes? Can I do anything for you?

**M:**&ensp;What can you give me that I do not have? Material things are needed for contentment. But I am contented with myself. What else do I need?

**Q:**&ensp;Surely, when you are hungry you need food and when sick you need medicine.

**M:**&ensp;Hunger brings the food and illness brings the medicine. It is all nature’s work.

**Q:**&ensp;If I bring something I believe you need, will you accept it?

**M:**&ensp;The love that made you offer will make me accept.

**Q:**&ensp;If somebody offers to build you a beautiful *ashram*?

**M:**&ensp;Let him, by all means. Let him spend a fortune, employ hundreds, feed thousands.

**Q:**&ensp;Is it not a desire?

**M:**&ensp;Not at all. I am only asking him to do it properly, not stingily, half-heartedly. He is fulfilling his own desire, not mine. Let him do it well and be famous among men and gods.

**Q:**&ensp;But do you want it?

**M:**&ensp;I do not want it.

**Q:**&ensp;Will you accept it?

**M:**&ensp;I don’t need it.

**Q:**&ensp;Will you stay in it?

**M:**&ensp;If I am compelled.

**Q:**&ensp;What can compel you?

**M:**&ensp;Love of those who are in search of light.

**Q:**&ensp;Yes, I see your point. Now, how am I to go into <span data-tippy-content="Superconscious state, profound meditation, trance, rapturous absorption. A practice of <em>yoga</em> in which the seeker (<em>sadhaka</em>) becomes one with the object of his meditation (<em>sadhya</em>), thus attaining unqualified bliss. “<em>Samadhi</em> is a state in which you transcend the bounds of your body, mind and self-identity, and merge into an undifferentiated unity with all that is”.">samadhi</span>?

**M:**&ensp;If you are in the right state, whatever you see will put you into *samadhi*. After all, *samadhi* is nothing unusual. When the mind is intensely interested, it becomes one with the object of interest — the seer and the seen become one in seeïng, the hearer and the heard become one in hearing, the lover and the loved become one in loving. Every experience can be the ground for *samadhi*.

**Q:**&ensp;Are you always in a state of *samadhi*?

**M:**&ensp;Of course not. *Samadhi* is a state of mind, after all. I am beyond all experience, even of *samadhi*. I am the great devourer and destroyer: whatever I touch dissolves into void (*akash*).

**Q:**&ensp;I need *samadhi*s for self-realisation.

**M:**&ensp;You have all the self-realisation you need, but you do not trust it. Have courage, trust yourself, go, talk, act; give it a chance to prove itself. With some, realisation comes imperceptibly, but somehow they need convincing. They have changed, but they do not notice it. Such non-spectacular cases are often the most reliable.

**Q:**&ensp;Can one believe himself to be realised and be mistaken?

**M:**&ensp;Of course. The very idea ‘I am self-realised’ is a mistake. There is no ‘I am this’. ‘I am that’ in the Natural State.
