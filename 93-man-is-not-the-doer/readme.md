# 93. Man Is Not the Doer

>[Your mind is not quiet.] It is because of your illusion that you are the doer. In reality things are done to you, not by you.

**Questioner:**&ensp;From the beginning of my life, I have been pursued by a sense of incompleteness. From school to college, to work, to marriage, to affluence, I imagined that the next thing will surely give me peace, but there was no peace. This sense of unfulfillment keeps on growing as years pass by.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;As long as there is the body and the sense of identity with the body, frustration is inevitable. Only when you know yourself as entirely alien to and different from the body, will you find respite from the mixture of fear and craving inseparable from the “I am the body” idea. Merely assuaging fears and satisfying desires will not remove this sense of emptiness you are trying to escape from; only self-knowledge can help you. By “self-knowledge” I mean full knowledge of what you are not. Such knowledge is attainable and final, but to the discovery of what you are, there can be no end. The more you discover, the more there remains to discover.

**Q:**&ensp;For this we must have different parents and schools, live in a different society.

**M:**&ensp;You cannot change your circumstances, but you can change your attitudes. You need not be 
attached to the non-essentials. Only the necessary is good. There is peace only in the essential.

**Q:**&ensp;It is truth I seek, not peace.

**M:**&ensp;You cannot see the true unless you are at peace. A quiet mind is essential for correct perception, 
which again is required for self-realisation.

**Q:**&ensp;I have so much to do. I just cannot afford to keep my mind quiet.

**M:**&ensp;It is because of your illusion that you are the doer. In reality things are done to you, not by you.

**Q:**&ensp;If I just let things happen, how can I be sure that they will happen my way? Surely I must bend 
them to my desire?

**M:**&ensp;Your desire just happens to you along with its fulfilment or non-fulfilment. You can change 
neither. You may believe that you exert yourself, strive and struggle. Again, it all merely happens, 
including the fruits of the work. Nothing is by you and for you. All is in the picture exposed on the 
cinema screen; nothing in the light, including what you take yourself to be, the person. You are the 
light only.

**Q:**&ensp;If I am light only, how did I come to forget it?

**M:**&ensp;You have not forgotten. It is in the picture on the screen that you forget and then remember. 
You never cease to be a man because you dream you are a tiger. Similarly, you are pure light 
appearing as a picture on the screen and also becoming one with it.

**Q:**&ensp;Since all just happens, why should I worry?

**M:**&ensp;Exactly. Freedom is freedom from worry. Having realised that you cannot influence the results, 
pay no attention to your desires and fears. Let them come and go. Don’t give them the nourishment 
of interest and attention.

**Q:**&ensp;If I turn my attention from what happens, what am I to live by?

**M:**&ensp;Again it is like asking, “What shall I do, if I stop dreaming?”. Stop and see. You need not be 
anxious — “What next?”. There is always the next. Life does not begin nor end — immovable, it moves, 
momentary, it lasts. Light can not be exhausted even if innumerable pictures are projected by it. 
So does life fill every shape to the brim and return to its source when the shape breaks down.

**Q:**&ensp;If life is so wonderful, how could ignorance happen?

**M:**&ensp;You want to treat the disease without having seen the patient! Before you ask about ignorance, 
why don’t you enquire first who is ignorant? When you say you are ignorant, you do not know 
that you have imposed the concept of ignorance over the actual state of your thoughts and feelings. 
Examine them as they occur, give them your full attention and you will find that there is nothing like 
ignorance, only inattention. Give attention to what worries you, that is all. After all, worry is mental 
pain and pain is invariably a call for attention. The moment you give attention, the call for it ceases 
and the question of ignorance dissolves. Instead of waiting for an answer to your question, find out 
who is asking the question and what makes him ask it. You will soon find that it is the mind, goaded 
by fear of pain, that asks the question. And in fear there is memory and anticipation, past and 
future. Attention brings you back to the present, the now, and the presence in the now is a state 
ever at hand, but rarely noticed.

**Q:**&ensp;You are reducing <span data-tippy-content="The practice which produces success, <em>siddhi</em>.">sadhana</span> to simple attention. How is it that other teachers teach complete, 
difficult and time-consuming courses?

**M:**&ensp;The <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</span>s usually teach the *sadhana*s by which they themselves have reached their goal, 
whatever their goal may be. This is but natural, for their own *sadhana* they know intimately. I was 
taught to give attention to my sense of “I Am” and I found it supremely effective. Therefore, I can 
speak of it with full confidence. But often people come with their bodies, brain and minds so 
mishandled, perverted and weak that the state of formless attention is beyond them. In such cases, 
some simpler token of earnestness is appropriate. The repetition of a <span data-tippy-content="Incantation, hymn, an instrument of thought, ideal sounds visualised as letters and vocalised as syllables. A <em>mantra</em> is a group of words whose constant repetition produces specific results.">mantra</span>, or gazing at a picture 
will prepare their body and mind for a deeper and more direct search. After all, it is earnestness that 
is indispensable, the crucial factor. *Sadhana* is only a vessel and it must be filled to the brim with 
earnestness, which is but love in action. For nothing can be done without love.

**Q:**&ensp;We love only ourselves.

**M:**&ensp;Were it so, it would be splendid! Love your self wisely and you will reach the summit of perfection. Everybody loves his body, but few love their real being.

**Q:**&ensp;Does my real being need my love?

**M:**&ensp;Your real being is love itself and your many loves are its reflections according to the situation at 
the moment.

**Q:**&ensp;We are selfish; we know only self-love.

**M:**&ensp;Good enough for a start. By all means, wish yourself well. Think over, feel out deeply what is 
really good for you and strive for it earnestly. Very soon you will find that the real is your only good.

**Q:**&ensp;Yet I do not understand why the various *guru*s insist on prescribing complicated and difficult 
*sadhana*s. Don’t they know better?

**M:**&ensp;It is not what you do, but what you stop doing that matters. The people who begin their *sadhana* 
are so feverish and restless that they have to be very busy to keep themselves on the track. An 
absorbing routine is good for them. After some time they quiet down and turn away from effort. In 
peace and silence the skin of the “I” dissolves and the inner and the outer become one. The real 
*sadhana* is effortless.

**Q:**&ensp;I have sometimes the feeling that space itself is my body.

**M:**&ensp;When you are bound by the illusion “I am this body”, you are merely a point in space and a 
moment in time. When the self-identification with the body is no more, all space and time are in your 
mind, which is a mere ripple in consciousness, which is awareness reflected in nature. Awareness 
and matter are the active and the passive aspects of pure being, which is in both and beyond both. 
Space and time are the body and the mind of the universal existence. My feeling is that all that 
happens in space and time happens to me, that every experience is my experience, every form is 
my form. What I take myself to be becomes my body and all that happens to that body becomes 
my mind. But at the root of the universe there is pure awareness, beyond space and time, here and 
now. Know it to be your real being and act accordingly.

**Q:**&ensp;What difference will it make in action what I take myself to be? Actions just happen according to
circumstances.

**M:**&ensp;Circumstances and conditions rule the ignorant. The knower of reality is not compelled. The 
only law he obeys is that of love.
