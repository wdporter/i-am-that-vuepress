# 40. Only the Self Is Real

>You imagine that without cause there can be no happiness. To me dependence on 
anything for happiness is utter misery. Pleasure and pain have causes, while 
my state is my own — totally uncaused, independent, unassailable.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;The world is but a show, glittering and empty. It is, and 
yet is not. It is there as long as I want to see it and take part in it. When 
I cease caring, it dissolves. It has no cause and serves no purpose. It just 
happens when we are absent-minded. It appears exactly as it looks, but there 
is no depth in it or meaning. Only the onlooker is real, wheterh you call him 
the Self or <span data-tippy-content="The Supreme Self, the individual soul. 
<em>Atman</em> is beyond all the three <em>gunas</em> of <em>prakriti</em>. It 
is not the <em>atman</em> that acts but only the 
<em>prakriti</em>.">Atma</span>. To the Self, the world is but a colourful 
show which he enjoys as long as it lasts and forgets when it is over. Whatever 
happens on the stage makes him shudder in terror or roll with laughter, yet 
all the time he is aware that it is but a show. Without desire or fear he 
enjoys it as it happens.

**Questioner:**&ensp;The person immersed in the world has a life of many 
flavours. He weeps and he laughs, loves and hates, desires and fears, suffers 
and rejoices. The desireless and fearless <span data-tippy-content="The 
knower, especially of the higher knowledge derived from meditation; “closely 
related to the knowledge of Brahman”.">jnani</span>, what life has he? Is he 
not left high and dry in his aloofness?

**M:**&ensp;His state is not so desolate. It tastes of the pure, uncaused, 
undiluted bliss. He is happy and fully aware that happiness is his very 
nature, and that he need not do anything or strive for anything to secure it. 
It follows him, more real than the body, nearer than the mind itself. You 
imagine that without cause there can be no happiness. To me dependence on 
anything for happiness is utter misery. Pleasure and pain have causes, while 
my state is my own — totally uncaused, independent, unassailable.

**Q:**&ensp;Like a play on the stage?

**M:**&ensp;The play was written, planned and rehearsed. The world just spouts 
into beïng out of nothing and returns to nothing.

**Q:**&ensp;Is there no creätor? Was not the world in the mind of <span 
data-tippy-content="One of the gods of the Hindu trinity: Brahma, the creätor; 
Vishnu, the preserver; Shiva, the destroyer.">Brahma</span> before it was 
creäted?

**M:**&ensp;As long as you are outside my state, you will have creätors, 
preservers and destroyers, but once with me you will know the Self only and 
see yourself in all.

**Q:**&ensp;You function nevertheless.

**M:**&ensp;When you are giddy, you see the world running circles round you. 
Obsessed with the idea of means and end, of work and purpose, you see me 
apparently functioning. In reality, I only look. Whatever is done is done on 
the stage. Joy and sorrow, life and death, they all are real to the man in 
bondage; to me they are all in the show, as unreal as the show itself. 

I may perceive the world just like you, but you believe yourself to be in it 
while I see it as an iridescent drop in the vast expanse of consciousness.

**Q:**&ensp;We are all getting old. Old age is not pleasant — all aches and 
pains, weakness, and the approaching end. How does a *jnani* feel as an old 
man? How does his inner self look at his own senility?

**M:**&ensp;As he gets older, he grows more and more happy and peaceful. After 
all, he is goïng home. Like a traveller nearing his destination and collecting 
his luggage, he leaves the train without regret.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely there is a contradiction. We are told the *jnani* is beyond 
all change. His happiness neither grows nor wanes. How can he grow happier 
because of beïng old, and that in spite of physical weakness and so on?

**M:**&ensp;There is no contradiction. The reel of destiny is coming to its 
end — the mind is happy. The mist of bodily existence is lifting — the burden 
of the body is growing less from day to day.

**Q:**&ensp;Let us say, the *jnani* is ill. He has caught some flu and every 
joint aches and burns. What is his state of mind?

**M:**&ensp;Every sensation is contemplated in perfect equanimity. There is no 
desire for it or refusal. It is as it is and he looks at it with a smile of 
affectionate detachment.

**Q:**&ensp;He may be detached from his own suffering, but still it is there.

**M:**&ensp;It is there, but it does not matter. Whatever state I am in, I see 
it as a state of mind to be accepted as it is.

**Q:**&ensp;Pain is pain. You experiënce it all the same.

**M:**&ensp;He who experiënces the body experiënces its pains and pleasures. I 
am neither the body, nor the experiëncer of the body.

**Q:**&ensp;Let us say you are twenty-five years old. Your marriage is 
arranged and performed and the household duties crowd upon you. How would you 
feel?

**M:**&ensp;Just as I feel now. You keep on insisting that my inner state is 
moulded by outer events. It is just not so. Whatever happens, I remain. At the 
root of my beïng is pure awareness, a speck of intense light. This speck, by 
its very nature, radiates and creätes pictures in space and events in time — 
effortlessly and spontaneöusly. As long as it is merely aware, there are no 
problems. But when the discriminative mind comes into beïng and creätes 
distinctions, pleasure and pain arise. During sleep the mind is in abeyance 
and so are pain and pleasure. The process of creätion continues, but no notice 
is taken. The mind is a form of consciousness, and consciousness is an aspect 
of life. Life creätes everything but the Supreme is beyond all.

**Q:**&ensp;The Supreme is the master and consciousness — his servant.

**M:**&ensp;The master is *in* consciousness, not beyond it. In terms of 
consciousness the Supreme is creätion and dissolution, concretion and 
abstraction, the focal and the universal. It is also neither. Words do not 
reach there, nor mind.

**Q:**&ensp;The *jnani* seems to be a very lonely beïng, all by himself.

**M:**&ensp;He is alone, but he is all. He is not even a beïng. He is the 
beïngness of all beïngs. Not even that. No words apply. He is what he is, the 
ground from which all grows.

**Q:**&ensp;Are you not afraid to die?

**M:**&ensp;I shall tell you how my <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual 
teacher, preceptor.">guru</span>’s *guru* died. After announcing that his end 
was nearing, he stopped eating, without changing the routine of his daily 
life. On the eleventh day, at prayer time he was singing and clapping 
vigorously and suddenly died! Just like that, between two movements, like a 
blown out candle. Everybody dies as he lives. I am not afraid of death because 
I am not afraid of life. I live a happy life and shall die a happy death. 
Misery is to be born, not to die. All depends how you look at it.

**Q:**&ensp;There can be no evidence of your state. All I know about it is 
what you say. All I see is a very interesting old man.

**M:**&ensp;You are the interesting old man, not me! I was never born. How can 
I grow old? What I appear to be to you exists only in your mind. I am not 
concerned with it.

**Q:**&ensp;Even as a dream, you are a most unusual dream.

**M:**&ensp;I am a dream that can wake you up. You will have the proof of it 
in your very waking up.

**Q:**&ensp;Imagine that the news reaches you that I have died. Somebody tells 
you, “You know so-and-so? He died”. What would be your reäction?

**M:**&ensp;I would be very happy to have you back home. Really glad to see 
you out of this foolishness.

**Q:**&ensp;Which foolishness?

**M:**&ensp;Of thinking that you were born and will die, that you are a body 
displaying a mind and all such nonsense. In my world nobody is born and nobody 
dies. Some people go on a journey and come back, some never leave. What 
difference does it make since they travel in dream-lands, each wrapped up in 
his own dream? Only the waking up is important. It is enough to know the ‘I 
am’ as reality and also love.

**Q:**&ensp;My approach is not so absolute, hence my question. Throughout the 
West people are in search of something real. They turn to science, which tells 
them a lot about matter, a little about the mind, and nothing about the nature 
and purpose of consciousness. To them reality is objective, outside the 
observable and describable, directly or by inference; about the subjective 
aspect of reality they know nothing. It is extremely important to let them 
know that there is reality and it is to be found in the freedom of 
consciousness from matter and its limitations and distortions. Most of the 
people in the world just do not know that there is reality which can be found 
and experiënced in consciousness. It seems very important that they should 
hear the good news from somebody who has actually experiënced it. Such 
witnesses have always existed and their testimony is precious.

**M:**&ensp;Of course. The gospel of self-realisation, once heard, will never 
be forgotten. Like a seed left in the ground, it will wait for the right 
season and sprout and grow into a mighty tree.
