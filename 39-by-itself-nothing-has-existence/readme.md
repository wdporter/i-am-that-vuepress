# 39. By Itself Nothing Has Existence

>By itself, nothing has existence. Everything needs its own absence. To be is 
to be distinguishable: to be here and not there, to be now and not then, to be 
thus and not otherwise… as light remains itself regardless of the colours it 
brings out, so does the real remain real, regardless of conditions in which it 
is reflected.

**Questioner:**&ensp;As I listen to you, I find that it is useless to ask you 
questions. Whatever the question, you invariably turn it upon itself and bring 
me to the basic fact that I am living in an illusion of my own making and that 
reälity is inexpressible in words. Words merely add to the confusion and the 
only wise course is the silent search within.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;After all, it is the mind that creates illusion and it is 
the mind that gets free of it. Words may aggravate illusion, but words may 
also help dispel it. There is nothing wrong in repeating the same truth again 
and again until it becomes reälity. A mother’s work is not over with the birth 
of the child. She feeds it day after day, year after year until it needs her 
no longer. People need hearing words, until facts speak to them louder than 
words.

**Q:**&ensp;So we are children to be fed on words?

**M:**&ensp;As long as you give importance to words, you are children.

**Q:**&ensp;All right, then be our mother.

**M:**&ensp;Where was the child before it was born? Was it not with the 
mother? Because it was already with the mother it could be born.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely the mother did not carry the child when she was a child 
herself.

**M:**&ensp;Potentially, she was the mother. Go beyond the illusion of time.

**Q:**&ensp;Your answer is always the same. A kind of clockwork which strikes 
the same hours again and again.

**M:**&ensp;It cannot be helped. Just like the one sun is reflected in a 
billion dew drops, so is the timeless endlessly repeated. When I repeat, “I 
am, I am”, I merely assert and reässert an ever-present fact. You get tired of 
my words because you do not see the living truth behind them. Contact it and 
you will find the full meaning of words and of silence — both.

**Q:**&ensp;You say that the little girl is already the mother of her future 
child. Potentially, yes. Actually, no.

**M:**&ensp;The potential becomes actual by thinking. The body and its affairs 
exist in the mind.

**Q:**&ensp;And the mind is consciousness in motion and consciousness is the 
conditioned (<span data-tippy-content="Manifested condition with the three 
<em>guna</em>s, qualities — <em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em> and 
<em>tamas</em>. The Supreme Absolute conceived of as possessing qualities like 
love, mercy etc., as distinguished from the undifferentiated Absolute of the 
<em>Advaita Vedanta</em>.">saguna</span>) aspect of the Self. The 
unconditioned (<span data-tippy-content="The unconditioned, without form, 
qualities or attributes.">nirguna</span>) is another aspect and beyond lies 
the abyss of the absolute (<span data-tippy-content="The sublime 
truth.">paramartha</span>).

**M:**&ensp;Quite right — you have put it beautifully.

**Q:**&ensp;But these are mere words to me. Hearing and repeating them is not 
enough; they must be experienced.

**M:**&ensp;Nothing stops you but preöccupation with the outer which prevents 
you from focussing the inner. It cannot be helped; you cannot skip your <span 
data-tippy-content="The practice which produces success, 
<em>siddhi</em>.">sadhana</span>. You have to turn away from the world and go 
within, until the inner and the outer merge and you can go beyond the 
conditioned, whether inner or outer.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely the unconditioned is merely an idea in the conditioned 
mind. By itself it has no existence.

**M:**&ensp;By itself, nothing has existence. Everything needs its own 
absence. To be is to be distinguishable: to be here and not there, to be now 
and not then, to be thus and not otherwise. Like water is shaped by the 
container, so is everything determined by conditions (<span 
data-tippy-content="Attributes, qualities. In <em>Samkhya</em> philosophy the 
three attributes of the cosmic substance (<em>prakriti</em>) are: illuminating 
(<em>sattva</em>), activating (<em>rajas</em>) and restraining 
(<em>tamas</em>).">guna</span>s). As water remains water regardless of the 
vessels, as light remains itself regardless of the colours it brings out, so 
does the real remain real, regardless of conditions in which it is reflected. 
Why keep the reflection only in the focus of consciousness? Why not the real 
itself?

**Q:**&ensp;Consciousness itself is a reflection. How can it hold the real?

**M:**&ensp;To know that consciousness and its content are but reflections, 
changeful and transient, is the focussing of the real. The refusal to see the 
snake in the rope is the necessary condition for seeïng the rope.

**Q:**&ensp;Only necessary or also sufficient?

**M:**&ensp;One must also know that a rope exists and looks like a snake. 
Similarly, one must know that the real exists and is of the nature of 
witness–consciousness. Of course it is beyond the witness, but to enter it one 
must first realise the state of pure witnessing. The awareness of conditions 
brings one to the unconditioned.

**Q:**&ensp;Can the unconditioned be experienced?

**M:**&ensp;To know the conditioned as conditioned is all that can be said 
about the unconditioned. Positive terms are mere hints and are misleading.

**Q:**&ensp;Can we talk of witnessing the real?

**M:**&ensp;How can we? We can talk only of the unreal, the illusory, the 
transient, the conditioned. To go beyond, we must pass through total negation 
of everything as having independent existence. All things depend.

**Q:**&ensp;On what do they depend?

**M:**&ensp;On consciousness. And consciousness depends on the witness.

**Q:**&ensp;And the witness depends on the real?

**M:**&ensp;The witness is the reflection of the real in all its purity. It 
depends on the condition of the mind. Where clarity and detachment 
predominate, the witness–consciousness comes into beïng. It is just like 
saying that where the water is clear and quiet, the image of the moon appears. 
Or like daylight that appears as sparkle in the diamond.

**Q:**&ensp;Can there be consciousness without the witness?

**M:**&ensp;Without the witness it becomes unconsciousness, just living. The 
witness is latent in every state of consciousness, just like light in every 
colour. There can be no knowledge without the knower and no knower without his 
witness. Not only do you know, but you know that you know.

**Q:**&ensp;If the unconditioned cannot be experienced, for all experience is 
conditioned, then why talk of it at all?

**M:**&ensp;How can there be knowledge of the conditioned without the 
unconditioned? There must be a source from which all this flows, a foundation 
on which all stands. Self-realisation is primarily the knowledge of one’s 
conditioning and the awareness that the infinite variety of conditions depends 
on our infinite ability to be conditioned and to give rise to variety. To the 
conditioned mind the unconditioned appears as the totality as well as the 
absence of everything. Neither can be directly experienced, but this does not 
make it not-existent.

**Q:**&ensp;Is it not a feeling?

**M:**&ensp;A feeling too is a state of mind. Just like a healthy body does 
not call for attention, so is the unconditioned free from experience. Take the 
experience of death. The ordinary man is afraid to die, because he is afraid 
of change. The <span data-tippy-content="The knower, especially of the higher 
knowledge derived from meditation; “closely related to the knowledge of 
Brahman”.">jnani</span> is not afraid because his mind is dead already. He 
does not think, “I live”. He knows, “There is life”. There is no change in it 
and no death. Death appears to be a change in time and space. Where there is 
neither time nor space, how can there be death? The *jnani* is already dead to 
name and shape. How can their loss affect him? The man in the train travels 
from place to place, but the man off the train goes nowhere, for he is not 
bound for a destination. He has nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to 
become. Those who make plans will be born to carry them out. Those who make no 
plans need not be born.

**Q:**&ensp;What is the purpose of pain and pleasure?

**M:**&ensp;Do they exist by themselves, or only in the mind?

**Q:**&ensp;Still, they exist. Never mind the mind.

**M:**&ensp;Pain and pleasure are merely symptoms, the results of wrong 
knowledge and wrong feeling. A result cannot have a purpose of its own.

**Q:**&ensp;In God’s economy, everything must have a purpose.

**M:**&ensp;Do you know God that you talk of him so freely? What is God to 
you? A sound, a word on paper, an idea in the mind?

**Q:**&ensp;By his power I am born and kept alive.

**M:**&ensp;And suffer, and die. Are you glad?

**Q:**&ensp;It may be my own fault that I suffer and die. I was created unto 
life eternal.

**M:**&ensp;Why eternal in the future and not in the past? What has a 
beginning must have an end. Only the beginningless is endless.

**Q:**&ensp;God may be a mere concept, a working theory. A very useful concept 
all the same!

**M:**&ensp;For this it must be free of inner contradictions, which is not the 
case. Why not work on the theory that you are your own creätion and creätor? 
At least there will be no external God to battle with.

**Q:**&ensp;This world is so rich and complex — how could I creäte it?

**M:**&ensp;Do you know yourself enough to know what you can do and what you 
cannot? You do not know your own powers. You never investigated. Begin with 
yourself now.

**Q:**&ensp;Everybody believes in God.

**M:**&ensp;To me you are your own God. But if you think otherwise, think to 
the end. If there be God, then all is God’s and all is for the best. Welcome 
all that comes with a glad and thankful heart. And love all creatures. This 
too will take you to your Self.
