# 33. To See the Unreal Is Wisdom

>To a <span style=font-style:normal>jnani</span> nothing has beginning or an 
ending. As salt dissolves in water, so does everything dissolve into pure 
beïng. Wisdom is eternally negating the unreal. To see the unreal is wisdom…

**Questioner:**&ensp;Does a <span data-tippy-content="The knower, especially 
of the higher knowledge derived from meditation; “closely related to the 
knowledge of Brahman”. (<em>jna</em>, to know; <em>jnani</em>, the 
knower.)">jnani</span> die?

**Maharaj:**&ensp;He is beyond life and death. What we take to be inevitable — 
to be born and to die — appears to him but a way of expressing movement in the 
Immovable, change in the changeless, end in the endless. To the *jnani* it is 
obvious that nothing is born and nothing dies, nothing lasts and nothing 
changes, all is as it is — timelessly.

**Q:**&ensp;You say the *jnani* is beyond. Beyond what? Beyond knowledge?

**M:**&ensp;Knowledge has its rising and setting. Consciousness comes into 
beïng and goes out of beïng. It is a matter of daily occurrence and 
observation. We all know that sometimes we are conscious and sometimes not. 
When we are not conscious, it appears to us as a darkness or a blank. But a 
*jnani* is aware of himself as neither conscious nor unconscious, but purely 
aware, a witness to the three states of the mind and their contents.

**Q:**&ensp;When does this witnessing begin?

**M:**&ensp;To a *jnani* nothing has beginning or an ending. As salt dissolves 
in water, so does everything dissolve into pure beïng. Wisdom is eternally 
negating the unreal. To see the unreal is wisdom. Beyond this lies the 
inexpressible.

**Q:**&ensp;There is in me the conviction, “I am the body”. Granted, I am 
talking from unwisdom. But the state of feeling oneself the body, the 
body–mind, the mind–body or even pure mind — when did it begin?

**M:**&ensp;You cannot speak of a beginning of consciousness. The very idea of 
beginning and time are within consciousness. To talk meaningfully of the 
beginning of anything, you must step out of it. And the moment you step out, 
you realise that there is no such thing and never was. There is only reälity, 
in which no thing has any beïng on its own. Like waves are inseparable from 
the ocean, so is all existence rooted in beïng.

**Q:**&ensp;The fact is that here and now I am asking you: When did the 
feeling ‘I am the body’ arise? At my birth? This morning?

**M:**&ensp;Now.

**Q:**&ensp;But I remember having it yesterday too!

**M:**&ensp;The memory of yesterday is now only.

**Q:**&ensp;But surely I exist in time. I have a past and a future.

**M:**&ensp;That is how you imagine — now.

**Q:**&ensp;There must have been a beginning.

**M:**&ensp;Now.

**Q:**&ensp;And what about ending?

**M:**&ensp;What has no beginning cannot end.

**Q:**&ensp;But I am conscious of my question.

**M:**&ensp;A false question cannot be answered. It can only be seen as false.

**Q:**&ensp;To me it is real.

**M:**&ensp;When did it appear real to you? Now?

**Q:**&ensp;Yes, it is quite real to me — now.

**M:**&ensp;What is real about your question? It is a state of mind. No state 
of mind can be more real than the mind itself. Is the mind real? It is but a 
collection of states, each of them transitory. How can a succession of 
transitory states be considered real?

**Q:**&ensp;Like beads on a string, events follow events — for ever.

**M:**&ensp;They are all strung on the basic idea ‘I am the body’. But even 
this is a mental state and does not last. It comes and goes like all other 
states. The illusion of beïng the body–mind is there only because it is not 
investigated. Non-investigation is the thread on which all the states of mind 
are strung. It is like darkness in a closed room. It is there — apparently. 
But when the room is opened, where does it go? It goes nowhere, because it was 
not there. All states of mind, all names and forms of existence are rooted in 
non-inquiry, non-investigation, in imagination and credulity. It is right to 
say, “I am”, but to say, “I am this”, “I am that”, is a sign of not enquiring, 
not examining, of mental weakness or lethargy.

**Q:**&ensp;If all is light, how did darkness arise? How can there be darkness 
in the midst of light?

**M:**&ensp;There is no darkness in the midst of light. Self-forgetfulness is 
the darkness. When we are absorbed in other things, in the not-self, we forget 
the self. There is nothing unnatural about it. But, why forget the self 
through excess of attachment? Wisdom lies in never forgetting the self as the 
ever-present source of both the experiencer and his experience.

**Q:**&ensp;In my present state the ‘I am the body’ idea comes spontaneously, 
while the ‘I am pure beïng’ idea must be imposed on the mind as something true 
but not experienced.

**M:**&ensp;Yes, <span data-tippy-content="The practice which produces 
success, <em>siddhi</em>.">sadhana</span> (practice) consists in reminding 
oneself forcibly of one’s pure ‘beïng-ness’, of not beïng anything in 
particular, nor a sum of particulars nor even the totality of all particulars, 
which make up a universe. All exists in the mind, even the body is an 
integration in the mind of a vast number of sensory perceptions and each 
perception also a mental state. If you say, “I am the body”, prove it.

**Q:**&ensp;Here it is.

**M:**&ensp;Only when you think of it. Both mind and body are intermittent 
states. The sum total of these flashes creätes the illusion of existence. 
Enquire what is permanent in the transient, real in the unreal. This is 
*sadhana*.

**Q:**&ensp;The fact is that I am thinking of myself as the body.

**M:**&ensp;Think of yourself by all means. Only don’t bring the idea of a 
body into the picture. There is only a stream of sensations, perceptions, 
memories and ideas. The body is an abstraction, creäted by our tendency to 
seek unity in diversity — which again is not wrong.

**Q:**&ensp;I am beïng told that to think ‘I am the body’ is a blemish in the 
mind.

**M:**&ensp;Why talk like this? Such expressions creäte problems. The self is 
the source of all, and of all — the final destination. Nothing is external.

**Q:**&ensp;When the body idea becomes obsessive, is it not altogether wrong?

**M:**&ensp;There is nothing wrong with the idea of a body, or even with the 
idea ‘I am the body’. But limiting oneself to only one body is a mistake. In 
reälity, all existence, every form, is my own and within my consciousness. I 
cannot tell what I am because words can describe only what I am not. I am, and 
because I am, all is. But I am beyond consciousness and, therefore, in 
consciousness I cannot say what I am. Yet, I am. The question ‘who am I?’ has 
no answer. No experience can answer it, for the self is beyond experience.

**Q:**&ensp;Still, the question ‘Who am I’ must be of some use.

**M:**&ensp;It has no answer in consciousness and therefore, helps to go 
beyond consciousness.

**Q:**&ensp;Here I am — in the present moment. What is real in it and what is 
not? Now please don’t tell me that my question is wrong. Questioning my 
questions leads me nowhere.

**M:**&ensp;Your question is not wrong. It is unnecessary. You said, “Here and 
now I am”. Stop there — this is real. Don’t turn a fact into a question. There 
lies your mistake. You are neither knowing nor not-knowing, neither mind nor 
matter; don’t attempt to describe yourself in terms of mind and matter.

**Q:**&ensp;Just now a boy came to you with a problem. You told him a few 
words and he went away. Did you help him?

**M:**&ensp;Of course.

**Q:**&ensp;How can you be so sure?

**M:**&ensp;To help is my nature.

**Q:**&ensp;How did you come to know it?

**M:**&ensp;No need to know. It operates by itself.

**Q:**&ensp;Still, you have made a statement. On what is it based?

**M:**&ensp;On what people tell me. But it is you who ask for proofs. I do not 
need them. Setting things right lies in my very nature, which is <span 
data-tippy-content="The true, the good, the beautiful.">satyam, shivam, 
sundaram</span> (the true, the good, the beautiful.).

**Q:**&ensp;When a man comes to you for advice and you give him advice, from 
where does it come and by what power does it help?

**M:**&ensp;His own beïng affects his mind and induces a response.

**Q:**&ensp;And what is your role?

**M:**&ensp;In me, the man and his self come together.

**Q:**&ensp;Why does not the self help the man without you?

**M:**&ensp;But I am the self! You imagine me as separate, hence your 
question. There is no ‘my self’ and ‘his self’. There is *the* Self, the only 
Self of all. Misled by the diversity of names and shapes, minds and bodies, 
you imagine multiple selves. We both are the self, but you seem to be 
unconvinced. This talk of personal self and universal self is the learner’s 
stage; go beyond, don’t be stuck in duälity.

**Q:**&ensp;Let us come back to the man in need of help. He comes to you.

**M:**&ensp;If he comes, he is sure to get help. He came because he was 
destined to get help. There is nothing fanciful about it. I cannot help some 
and refuse others. All who come are helped, for such is the law. The shape 
that the help takes varies according to the need.

**Q:**&ensp;Why must he come here to get advice? Can’t he get it from within?

**M:**&ensp;He will not listen. His mind is turned outward. But in fact all 
experience is in the mind, and even his coming to me and getting help is all 
within himself. Instead of finding an answer within himself, he imagines an 
answer from without. To me, there is no me, no man and no giving. All this is 
merely a flicker in the mind. I am infinite peace and silence in which nothing 
appears, for all that appears — disappears. Nobody comes for help, nobody 
offers help, nobody gets help. It is all but a display in consciousness.

**Q:**&ensp;Yet the power to help is there, and there is somebody or something 
that displays that power, call it God or Self or the Universal Mind. The name 
does not matter, but the fact does.

**M:**&ensp;This is the stand the body–mind takes. The pure mind sees things 
as they are — bubbles in consciousness. These bubbles are appearing, 
disappearing and reäppearing — without having real beïng. No particular cause 
can be ascribed to them, for each is caused by all and affects all. Each 
bubble is a body and all these bodies are mine.

**Q:**&ensp;Do you mean to say, that you have the power to do everything 
rightly?

**M:**&ensp;There is no power as separate from me. It is inherent in my very 
nature. Call it creätivity. Out of a lump of gold you can make many ornaments 
— each will remain gold. Similarly, in whatever role I may appear and whatever 
function I may perform — I remain what I am: the ‘I am’ — immovable, 
unshakeable, independent. What you call the universe, or nature, is my 
spontaneous creätivity. Whatever happens — happens. But such is my nature that 
all ends in joy.

**Q:**&ensp;I have a case of a boy gone blind because his stupid mother fed 
him methyl alcohol. I am requesting you to help him. You are full of 
compassion and, obviously, eager to help. By what power can you help him?

**M:**&ensp;His case is registered in consciousness. It is there — indelibly. 
Consciousness will operate.

**Q:**&ensp;Does it make any difference that I ask you to help?

**M:**&ensp;Your asking is a part of the boy’s blindness. Because he is blind, 
you ask. You have added nothing.

**Q:**&ensp;But your help will be a new factor?

**M:**&ensp;No, all is contained in the boy’s blindness. All is in it — the 
mother, the boy, you and me, and all else. It is one event.

**Q:**&ensp;You mean to say that even our discussing the boy’s case was 
predestined?

**M:**&ensp;How else? All things contain their future. The boy appears in 
consciousness. I am beyond. I do not issue orders to consciousness. I know 
that it is in the nature of awareness to set things right. Let consciousness 
look after its creätions! The boy’s sorrow, your pity, my listening and my 
consciousness acting — all this is one single fact. don’t split it into 
components and then ask questions.

**Q:**&ensp;How strangely your mind works!

**M:**&ensp;You are strange, not me. I am normal. I am sane. I see things as 
they are, and therefore I am not afraid of them. But you are afraid of reälity.

**Q:**&ensp;Why should I be?

**M:**&ensp;It is ignorance of yourself that makes you afraid and also unaware 
that you are afraid. Don’t try not to be afraid. Break down the wall of 
ignorance first. 

People are afraid to die, because they do not know what death is. The *jnani* 
has died before his death, he saw that there was nothing to be afraid of. The 
moment you know your real beïng, you are afraid of nothing. Death gives 
freedom and power. To be free in the world, you must die to the world. Then 
the universe is your own; it becomes your body, an expression and a tool. The 
happiness of beïng absolutely free is beyond description. On the other hand, 
he who is afraid of freedom cannot die.

**Q:**&ensp;You mean that one who cannot die cannot live?

**M:**&ensp;Put it as you like — attachment is bondage, detachment is freedom. 
To crave is to slave.

**Q:**&ensp;Does it follow that if you are saved, the world is saved?

**M:**&ensp;As a whole the world does not need saving. Man makes mistakes and 
creätes sorrow; when it enters the field of awareness, the consciousness of a 
*jnani*, it is set right. Such is his nature.

**Q:**&ensp;We can observe what may be called ‘spiritual progress’. A selfish 
man turns religious, controls himself, refines his thoughts and feelings, 
takes to spiritual practice, and realises his true beïng. Is such progress 
ruled by causality or is it accidental?

**M:**&ensp;From my point of view, everything happens by itself, quite 
spontaneously. But man imagines that he works for an incentive, towards a 
goal. He has always a reward in mind and strives for it. 

**Q:**&ensp;A crude, unevolved man will not work without a reward. Is it not 
right to offer him incentives?

**M:**&ensp;He will creäte for himself incentives anyhow. He does not know 
that to grow is in the nature of consciousness. He will progress from motive 
to motive and will chase <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, 
preceptor.">guru</span>s for the fulfilment of his desires. When by the laws 
of his beïng he finds the way of return (<span data-tippy-content="Liberation 
from worldly existence, renunciation.">nivritti</span>), he abandons all 
motives, for his interest in the world is over. He wants nothing — neither 
from others nor from himself. He dies to all and becomes the All. To want 
nothing and do nothing — that is true creätion! To watch the universe emerging 
and subsiding in one’s heart is a wonder.

**Q:**&ensp;The great obstacle to inner effort is boredom. The disciple gets 
bored.

**M:**&ensp;Inertia and restlessness (<span data-tippy-content="Darkness, 
inertia, passivity. One of the three constituents (<em>guna</em>s) of the 
cosmic substance: <em>sattava</em>, <em>rajas</em> and 
<em>tamas</em>.">tamas</span> and <span data-tippy-content="Motivity, 
activity, energy. One of the three <em>guna</em>s or qualities of matter: 
<em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>. In <em>yoga</em>, 
egoïsm.">rajas</span>) work together and keep clarity and harmony (<span 
data-tippy-content="Beïng, existence, true essence. In <em>yoga</em> the 
quality of purity or goodness.">sattva</span>) down. *Tamas* and *rajas* must 
be conquered before *sattva* can appear. It will all come in due course, quite 
spontaneously.

**Q:**&ensp;Is there no need of effort then?

**M:**&ensp;When effort is needed, effort will appear. When effortlessness 
becomes essential, it will assert itself. You need not push life about. Just 
flow with it and give yourself completely to the task of the present moment, 
which is the dying now to the now. For living is dying. Without death life 
cannot be. 

Get hold of the main thing: that the world and the self are one and perfect. 
Only your attitude is faulty and needs reädjustment. This process or 
reädjustment is what you call *sadhana*. You come to it by putting an end to 
indolence and using all your energy to clear the way for clarity and charity. 
But in reälity, these all are signs of inevitable growth. Don’t be afraid, 
don’t resist, don’t delay. Be what you are. There is nothing to be afraid of. 
Trust and try. Experiment honestly. Give your real beïng a chance to shape 
your life. You will not regret it.
