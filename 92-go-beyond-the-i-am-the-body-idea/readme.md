# 92. Go Beyond the ‘I am the Body’ Idea
> … Go beyond the ‘I am the body idea and you will find that space and time are in you and not you in space and time. Once you have 
understood this, the main obstacle to realisation is removed.

**Questioner:**&ensp;We are like animals running about in vain pursuits and there seems to be no end to it. 
Is there a way out?

**Maharaj:**&ensp;Many ways will be offered to you which will but take you round and bring you back to your 
starting point. First realise that your problem exists in your waking state only; that however painful it 
is, you are able to forget it altogether when you go to sleep. When you are awake you are 
conscious; when you are asleep, you are only alive. Consciousness and life — both you may call 
God; but you are beyond both, beyond God, beyond being and not-being. What prevents you from 
knowing yourself as all and beyond all is the mind, which is based on memory. It has power over you as long 
as you trust it. Don’t struggle with it — just disregard it. Deprived of attention, it will slow down and 
reveal the mechanism of its working. Once you know its nature and purpose, you will not allow it to 
create imaginary problems.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely, not all problems are imaginary. There are real problems.

**M:**&ensp;What problems can there be which the mind did not create? Life and death do not create 
problems; pains and pleasures come and go, experienced and forgotten. It is memory and 
anticipation that create problems of attainment or avoidance, coloured by like and dislike. Truth and 
love are man’s real nature, and mind and heart are the means of its expression.

**Q:**&ensp;How does one bring the mind under control? And the heart, which does not know what it wants?

**M:**&ensp;They cannot work in darkness. They need the light of pure awareness to function rightly. All 
effort at control will merely subject them to the dictates of memory. Memory is a good servant, but a 
bad master. It effectively prevents discovery. There is no place for effort in reality. It is selfishness, 
due to a self-identification with the body, that is the main problem and the cause of all other 
problems. And selfishness cannot be removed by effort, only by clear insight into its causes and 
effects. Effort is a sign of conflict between incompatible desires. They should be seen as they are — 
then only they dissolve.

**Q:**&ensp;And what remains?

**M:**&ensp;That which cannot change remains. The great peace, the deep silence and the hidden beauty of 
reality remain. While it can not be conveyed through words, it is waiting for you to experience for 
yourself.

**Q:**&ensp;Must not one be fit and eligible for realisation? Our nature is animal to the core. Unless it is 
conquered, how can we hope for reality to dawn?

**M:**&ensp;Leave the animal alone. Just remember what you are. Use every incident of the day to 
remind you that without you as the witness there would be neither animal nor God. Understand that 
you are both the essence and the substance of all there is, and remain firm in your understanding.

**Q:**&ensp;Is understanding enough? Don’t I need more tangible proofs?

**M:**&ensp;It is your understanding that will decide about the validity of proofs. But what more tangible 
proof do you need than your own existence? Wherever you go, you find yourself. However far you 
reach out in time, you are there.

**Q:**&ensp;Obviously, I am not all-pervading and eternal. I am only here and now.

**M:**&ensp;Good enough. The ’here’ is everywhere and the ‘now’ — always. Go beyond the ‘I am the body’ 
idea and you will find that space and time are in you and not you in space and time. Once you have 
understood this, the main obstacle to realisation is removed.

**Q:**&ensp;What is the realisation which is beyond understanding?

**M:**&ensp;Imagine a dense forest full of tigers and you in a strong steel cage. Knowing that you are well 
protected by the cage, you watch the tigers fearlessly. Next you find the tigers in the cage and 
yourself roaming about in the jungle. Last, the cage disappears and you ride the tigers!

**Q:**&ensp;I attended one of the group meditation sessions held recently in Bombay and witnessed the 
frenzy and self-abandon of the participants. Why do people go for such things?

**M:**&ensp;These are all inventions of a restless mind pampering to people in search of sensations. Some 
of them help the unconscious to disgorge suppressed memories and longings and to that extent 
they provide relief. But ultimately they leave the practitioner where he was — or worse.

**Q:**&ensp;I have read recently a book by a <span data-tippy-content="One who practices <em>yoga</em>.">yogi</span> on his experiences in meditation. It is full of visions and 
sounds, colours and melodies; quite a display and most gorgeous entertainment. In the end, they 
all faded out and only the feeling of utter fearlessness remained. No wonder — a man who passed 
through all these experiences unscathed need not be afraid of anything! Yet I was wondering of 
what use is such book to me?

**M:**&ensp;Of no use, probably, since it does not attract you. Others may be impressed. People differ. But 
all are faced with the fact of their own existence. ‘I am’ is the ultimate fact; ‘Who am I?’ is the 
ultimate question to which everybody must find an answer.

**Q:**&ensp;The same answer?

**M:**&ensp;The same in essence, varied in expression. 
Each seeker accepts or invents a method which suits him, applies it to himself with some 
earnestness and effort, obtains results according to his temperament and expectations, casts them 
into the mound of words, builds them into a system, establishes a tradition and begins to admit 
others into his ‘school of <span data-tippy-content="One of the six systems of the Hindu philosophy (from <em>yoj</em>, to yoke or join). <em>Yoga</em> teaches the means by which the individual spirit (<em>jivatma</em>) can be joined or united with the universal spirit (<em>Paramatma</em>).">yoga</span>’. It is all built on memory and imagination. No such school is 
valueless nor indispensable; in each, one can progress up to the point when all desire for progress 
must be abandoned to make further progress possible. Then all schools are given up, all effort 
ceases; in solitude and darkness, the last step is made which ends ignorance and fear forever.

The true teacher, however, will not imprison his disciple in a prescribed set of ideas, feelings and 
actions; on the contrary, he will show him patiently the need to be free from all ideas and set 
patterns of behaviour, to be vigilant and earnest and go with life wherever it takes him, not to enjoy 
or suffer, but to understand and learn.

Under the right teacher the disciple learns to learn, not to remember and obey. <span data-tippy-content="Association with the true and the wise people.">Satsang</span>, the 
company of the noble, does not mould, it liberates. Beware of all that makes you dependent. Most 
of the so-called ‘surrenders to the <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</span>’ end in disappointment, if not in tragedy. Fortunately, an 
earnest seeker will disentangle himself in time, the wiser for the experience.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely, self-surrender has its value.

**M:**&ensp;Self-surrender is the surrender of all self-concern. It cannot be done — it happens when you 
realise your true nature. Verbal self-surrender, even when accompanied by feeling, is of little value 
and breaks down under stress. At the best, it shows an aspiration, not an actual fact.

**Q:**&ensp;In the *Rig-veda* there is the mention of the <span data-tippy-content="[<em>adhi</em>, above, supreme + <em>yoga</em>] the Supreme yoga.">adhi yoga</span>, the Primordial *Yoga*, consisting of the 
marriage of <span data-tippy-content="Cognitive consciousness, pure awareness, higher consciousness.">prajna</span> with <span data-tippy-content="The breath of life, vital principle.">prana</span>, which, as I understand, means the bringing together of wisdom and 
life. Would you say it means also the union of *dharma* and <span data-tippy-content="Action or “the fruits of action”. <em>Karma</em> is of three kinds: <em>sanchita</em> (accumulated from previous births), <em>prarabdha</em> (portion of the past <em>karma</em> to be worked out in the present life) and <em>agami</em> (the current <em>karma</em> the result of which will fructify in future).">karma</span>, righteousness and action?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, provided by ‘righteousness’ you mean harmony with one’s true nature and by ‘action’ — only 
unselfish and desireless action.

In *adhi yoga* life itself is the *guru* and the mind is the disciple. The mind attends to life; it does not 
dictate. Life flows naturally and effortlessly and the mind removes the obstacles to its even flow.

**Q:**&ensp;Is not life by its very nature repetitive? Will not following life lead to stagnation?

**M:**&ensp;By itself life is immensely creative. A seed, in course of time, becomes a forest. The mind is like 
a forester — protecting and regulating the immense vital urge of existence.

**Q:**&ensp;Seen as the service of life by the mind, the *adhi yoga* is a perfect democracy. Everyone is 
engaged in living a life to his best capacity and knowledge; everyone is a disciple of the same *guru*.

**M:**&ensp;You may say so. It may be so — potentially. But unless life is loved and trusted, followed with 
eagerness and zest, it would be fanciful to talk of *yoga*, which is a movement in consciousness, 
awareness in action.

**Q:**&ensp;Once I watched a mountain stream flowing between boulders. At each boulder the 
commotion was different according to the shape and size of the boulder. Is not every person a 
mere commotion over a body, while life is one and eternal?

**M:**&ensp;The commotion and the water are not separate. It is the disturbance that makes you aware of 
water. Consciousness is always of movement, of change. There can be no such thing as 
changeless consciousness. Changelessness wipes out consciousness immediately. A man 
deprived of outer or inner sensations blanks out or goes beyond consciousness and 
unconsciousness into the birthless and deathless state. Only when spirit and matter come together 
is consciousness born.

**Q:**&ensp;Are they one or two?

**M:**&ensp;It depends on the words you use: they are one, two or three. On investigation three becomes 
two and the two become one. Take the simile of face, mirror and image. Any two of them presuppose 
the third which unites the two. In <span data-tippy-content="The practice which produces success, <em>siddhi</em>.">sadhana</span> you see the three as two, until you realise the two as one.

A long as you are engrossed in the world, you are unable to know yourself. To know yourself, turn away your attention from the world and turn it within.

**Q:**&ensp;I cannot destroy the world.

**M:**&ensp;There is no need. Just understand that what you see is not what is. Appearances will dissolve 
on investigation and the underlying reality will come to the surface. You need not burn the house to 
get out of it. You just walk out. It is only when you cannot come and go freely that the house 
becomes a jail. I move in and out of consciousness easily and naturally and therefore to me, the 
world is a home, not a prison.

**Q:**&ensp;But ultimately is there a world, or is there none?

**M:**&ensp;What you see is nothing but yourself. Call it what you like; it does not change the fact. Through 
the film of destiny your own light depicts pictures on the screen. You are the viewer, the light, the 
picture and the screen. Even the film of destiny (<span 
data-tippy-content="Destiny, <em>sanchita karma</em> (karma of past lives) 
that has become the destiny in the present life.">prarabdha</span>) is self-selected and self-imposed. The 
spirit is a sport and enjoys to overcome obstacles. The harder the task the deeper and wider his self-realisation.
