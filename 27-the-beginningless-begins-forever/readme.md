# 27. The Beginningless Begins Forever

>The beginningless begins forever. In the same way, I give eternally because I have nothing. To be nothing, to have nothing, to keep nothing for oneself is the greatest gift, the highest generosity.

**Questioner:**&ensp;The other day I was asking you about the two ways of growth, renunciation and enjoyment (<span data-tippy-content="One of the six systems of the Hindu philosophy (from <em>yoj</em>, to yoke or join). <em>yoga</em> teaches the means by which the individual spirit (<em>jivatma</em>) can be joined or united with the universal spirit (<em>Paramatma</em>).">yoga</span> and <span data-tippy-content="Sense enjoyment, experience of worldly joys and sorrows.">bhoga</span>). The difference is not so great as it looks — the <span data-tippy-content="One who practices <em>yoga</em>.">yogi</span> renounces to enjoy; the <span data-tippy-content="A <em>bhogi</em> is one involved in worldly joys and sorrows. <em>bhoga marga</em>, is the path of worldly pursuits — joys and sorrows.">bhogi</span> enjoys to renounce. The *ogi* renounces first, the *bhogi* enjoys first.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;So what? Leave the *yogi* to his *yoga* and the *bhogi* to his *bhoga*.

**Q:**&ensp;The way of *bhoga* seems to me the better one. The *yogi* is like a green mango, separated from the tree prematurely and kept to ripen in a basket of straw. Airless and overheated, it does get ripe, but the true flavour and fragrance are lost. The mango left on the tree grows to full size, colour and sweetness, a joy in every way. Yet somehow *yoga* gets all the praises and *bhoga* all the curses. As I see it, bhoga is the better of the two.

**M:**&ensp;What makes you say so?

**Q:**&ensp;I watched the *yogi*s and their enormous efforts. Even when they realise, there is something bitter or astringent about it. They seem to spend much of their time in trances and when they speak, they merely voice their scriptures. At their best such <span data-tippy-content="The knower, especially of the higher knowledge derived from meditation; “closely related to the knowledge of Brahman”.">jnani</span>s are like flowers — perfect, but just little flowers, shedding their fragrance within a short radius. There are some others, who are like forests — rich, varied, immense, full of surprises, a world in themselves. There must be a reason for this difference.

**M:**&ensp;Well, you said it. According to you one got stunted in his *yoga*, while the other flourished in *bhoga*. 

**Q:**&ensp;Is it not so? The *yogi* is afraid of life and seeks peace, while the *bhogi* is adventurous, full of spirit, forward-going. The *yogi* is bound by an ideal, while the *bhogi* is always ready to explore.

**M:**&ensp;It is a matter of wanting much or being satisfied with little. The *yogi* is ambitious while the *bhogi* is merely adventurous. Your *bhogi* seems to be richer and more interesting, but it is not so in reality. The *yogi* is narrow as the sharp edge of the knife. He has to be — to cut deep and smoothly, to penetrate unerringly the many layers of the false. The *bhogi* worships at many altars; the *yogi* serves none but his own true Self. 

There is no purpose in opposing the *yogi* to the *bhogi*. The way of outgoing (<span data-tippy-content="Penchant, predilection towards worldly life.">pravritti</span>) necessarily precedes the way of returning (<span data-tippy-content="Liberation from worldly existence, renunciation.">nivritti</span>). To sit in judgement and allot marks is ridiculous. Everything contributes to the ultimate perfection. Some say there are three aspects of reality: truth, wisdom and bliss. He who seeks Truth becomes a *yogi*; he who seeks wisdom becomes a *jnani*; he who seeks happiness becomes the man of action.

**Q:**&ensp;We are told of the bliss of non-duality.

**M:**&ensp;Such bliss is more of the nature of a great peace. Pleasure and pain are the fruits of actions, righteous and unrighteous.

**Q:**&ensp;What makes the difference?

**M:**&ensp;The difference is between giving and grasping. Whatever the way of approach, in the end all becomes one.

**Q:**&ensp;If there be no difference in the goal, why discriminate between various approaches?

**M:**&ensp;Let each act according to his nature. The ultimate purpose will be served in any case. All your discriminations and classifications are quite all right, but they do not exist in my case. As the description of a dream may be detailed and accurate, though without having any foundation, so does your pattern fit nothing but your own assumptions. You begin with an idea and you end with the same idea under a different garb.

**Q:**&ensp;How do you see things?

**M:**&ensp;One and all are the same to me. The same consciousness (<span data-tippy-content="Universal consciousness.">chit</span>) appears as being (<span data-tippy-content="“The ideal; pure and true essence (nature)” of an entity or existence. It can thus be concluded as “the self-existent or universal spirit, Brahman”. Opposite is ‘<em>asat</em>’.">sat</span>) and as bliss (<span data-tippy-content="Bliss, happiness.">ananda</span>): *Chit* in movement is *ananda*; *chit* motionless is being.

**Q:**&ensp;Still you are making a distinction between motion and motionlessness.

**M:**&ensp;Non-distinction speaks in silence. Words carry distinctions. The unmanifested (<span data-tippy-content="The unconditioned, without form, qualities and attributes.">nirguna</span>) has no name; all names refer to the manifested (<span data-tippy-content="Manifested condition with the three <em>guna</em>s, qualities — <em>sattva</em>, <em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>. The Supreme Absolute conceived of as possessing qualities like love, mercy etc., as distinguished from the undifferentiated Absolute of the <em>Advaita Vedanta</em>.">saguna</span>). It is useless to struggle with words to express what is beyond words. Consciousness (<span data-tippy-content="Consciousness–bliss, the joy of spirit.">chidananda</span>) is spirit (<span data-tippy-content="The cosmic spirit, the eternal and efficient cause of the universe that gives appearance of consciousness to all manifestations of matter (<em>prakriti</em>). The bondage of <em>purusha</em> in matter is due to ‘I’-consciousness born of <em>chitta–vrittis</em>, which gives rise to innumerable desires.">purusha</span>), consciousness is matter (<span data-tippy-content="The cosmic substance, the original uncaused cause of phenomenal existence, which is formless, limitless, immobile, eternal and all-pervasive, also called <em>avyakta</em>.">prakriti</span>). Imperfect spirit is matter, perfect matter is spirit. In the beginning, as in the end, all is one. 

All division is in the mind (<span data-tippy-content="Individual consciousness. It may be described as a product of both consciousness and matter or <em>purusha</em> and <em>prakriti</em>. <em>Chitta</em> comprises all the levels of mind, the lowest of which is <em>manas</em>.">chitta</span>); there is none in reality (*chit*). Movement and rest are states of mind and cannot be without their opposites. By itself nothing moves, nothing rests. It is a grievous mistake to attribute absolute existence to mental constructs. Nothing exists by itself.

**Q:**&ensp;You seem to identify rest with the Supreme State.

**M:**&ensp;There is rest as a state of mind (<span data-tippy-content="Joy of consciousness.">chidaram</span>) and there is rest as a state of being (<span data-tippy-content="Rejoicing in the Self.">atmaram</span>). The former comes and goes, while true rest is the very heart of action. Unfortunately, language is a mental tool and works only in opposites.

**Q:**&ensp;As a witness, you are working or at rest?

**M:**&ensp;Witnessing is an experience and rest is freedom from experience.

**Q:**&ensp;Can’t they coëxist, as the tumult of the waves and the quiet of the deep coëxist in the ocean?

**M:**&ensp;Beyond the mind there is no such thing as experience. Experience is a dual state. You cannot talk of reality as an experience. Once this is understood, you will no longer look for being and becoming as separate and opposite. In reality they are one and inseparable, like roots and branches of the same tree. Both can exist only in the light of consciousness, which again arises in the wake of the sense ‘I am’. This is the primary fact. If you miss it, you miss all.

**Q:**&ensp;Is the sense of being a product of experience only? The great saying (<span data-tippy-content="The sublime pronouncement. Four <em>Upanishad</em>ic declarations, expressing the highest <em>Vedant</em>ic truths, are known as <em>Maha-vakya</em>s. They are: <em>Prajnanam Brahman</em> (consciousness is Brahman), <em>aham Brahmasmi</em> (I am Brahman), <em>tat tvam asi</em> (That Thou Art) and <em>ayam atma Brahma</em> (the self is Brahman).">mahavakya</span>), <span data-tippy-content="[<em>tat</em>, that + <em>sat</em>, truth, being, reality] That is the truth. The sacred text is “<em>Om Tat Sat</em>” in which <em>Brahman</em> is identified by each of the three words.">tatsat</span> — is it a mere mode of mentation?

**M:**&ensp;Whatever is spoken is speech only. Whatever is thought is thought only. The real meaning is unexplainable, although experienceable. The *mahavakya* is true, but your ideas are false, for all ideas (<span data-tippy-content="Imagination, fancy.">kalpana</span>) are false.

**Q:**&ensp;Is the conviction, ‘I Am That’ false?

**M:**&ensp;Of course. Conviction is a mental state. In ‘That’ there is no ‘I am’. With the sense ‘I am’ emerging, ‘That’ is obscured, as with the sun rising the stars are wiped out. But as the sun comes with light, so with the sense of self comes bliss (*chidananda*). The cause of bliss is sought in the ‘not—I’ and thus the bondage begins.

**Q:**&ensp;In your daily life are you always conscious of your real state?

**M:**&ensp;Neither conscious nor unconscious. I do not need convictions. I live on courage. Courage is my essence, which is love of life. I am free of memories and anticipations, unconcerned with what I am and what I am not. I am not addicted to self descriptions, <span data-tippy-content="‘I Am He’.">soham</span> and <span data-tippy-content="[<em>Brahman</em>, the Supreme + <em>asmi</em>, I am, as, to be] I am the Supreme. ‘I am’ (<em>asmi</em>) represents the pure awareness of self-existence and is therefore the expression of pure consciousness or the <em>Purusha</em>. When this pure consciousness gets involved in matter, the pure ‘I am’ changes into ‘I am that’, ‘I am so-and-so’.">brahmasmi</span> (‘I am He’, ‘I am the Supreme’) are of no use to me. I have the courage to be as nothing and to see the world as it is: nothing. It sounds simple, just try it!

**Q:**&ensp;But what gives you courage?

**M:**&ensp;How perverted are your views! Need courage be given? Your question implies that anxiety is the normal state and courage is abnormal. It is the other way around. Anxiety and hope are born of imagination — I am free of both. I am simple *being* and I need nothing to rest on.

**Q:**&ensp;Unless you know yourself, of what use is your being to you? To be happy with what you are, you must know what you are.

**M:**&ensp;Being shines as knowing, knowing is warm in love. It is all one. You imagine separations and trouble yourself with questions. Don’t concern yourself overmuch with formulations. Pure being cannot be described.

**Q:**&ensp;Unless a thing is knowable and enjoyable, it is of no use to me. It must become a part of my experience, first of all.

**M:**&ensp;You are dragging down reality to the level of experience. How can reality depend on experience, when it is the very ground (<span data-tippy-content="Support.">adhar</span>) of experience. Reality is in the very fact of experience, not in its nature. Experience is, after all, a state of mind, while being is definitely not a state of mind.

**Q:**&ensp;Again I am confused! Is being separate from knowing?

**M:**&ensp;The separation is an appearance. Just as the dream is not apart from the dreamer, so is knowing not apart from being. The dream is the dreamer, the knowledge is the knower: the distinction is merely verbal.

**Q:**&ensp;I can see now that *sat* and *chit* are one. But what about bliss (*ananda*)? Being and consciousness are always present together, but bliss flashes only occasionally.

**M:**&ensp;The undisturbed state of being is bliss; the disturbed state is what appears as the world. In non-duality there is bliss; in duality — experience. What comes and goes is experience with its duality of pain and pleasure. Bliss is not to be known. One is always bliss, but never blissful. Bliss is not an attribute.

**Q:**&ensp;I have another question to ask: Some *yogi*s attain their goal but it is of no use to others. They do not know or are not able to share. Those who can share what they have initiate others. Where lies the difference?

**M:**&ensp;There is no difference. Your approach is wrong. There are no others to help. A rich man, when he hands over his entire fortune to his family, has not a coin left to give a beggar. So is the wise man (*jnani*) stripped of all his powers and possessions. Nothing, literally nothing, can be said about him. He cannot help anybody, for he is everybody. He is the poor and also his poverty, the thief and also his thievery. How can he be said to help when he is not apart? Who thinks of himself as separate from the world, let him help the world.

**Q:**&ensp;Still, there is duality, there is sorrow, there is need of help. By denouncing it as mere dream nothing is achieved.

**M:**&ensp;The only thing that can help is to wake up from the dream.

**Q:**&ensp;An awakener is needed.

**M:**&ensp;Who again is in the dream? The awakener signifies the beginning of the end. There are no eternal dreams.

**Q:**&ensp;Even when it is beginningless?

**M:**&ensp;Everything begins with you. What else is beginningless?

**Q:**&ensp;I began at birth.

**M:**&ensp;That is what you are told. Is it so? Did you see yourself beginning?

**Q:**&ensp;I began just now. All else is memory.

**M:**&ensp;Quite right. The beginningless begins forever. In the same way, I give eternally because I have nothing. To be nothing, to have nothing, to keep nothing for oneself is the greatest gift, the highest generosity.

**Q:**&ensp;Is there no self-concern left?

**M:**&ensp;Of course I am self-concerned, but the self is all. In practice it takes the shape of goodwill, unfailing and universal. You may call it love, all-pervading, all-redeeming. Such love is supremely active — without the sense of doing.
