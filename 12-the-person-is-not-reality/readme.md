# 12. The Person is not Reality

**Questioner:**&ensp;Kindly tell us how you realised.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;I met my <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</span> when I was thirty-four and realised by thirty-seven.

**Q:**&ensp;What happened? What was the change?

**M:**&ensp;Pleasure and pain lost their sway over me. I was free from desire and fear. I found myself full, needing nothing. I saw that in the ocean of pure awareness, on the surface of the universal consciousness, the numberless waves of the phenomenal worlds arise and subside beginninglessly and endlessly. As consciousness, they are all me. As events, they are all mine. There is a mysterious power that looks after them. That power is awareness, Self, Life, God, whatever name you give it. It is the foundation, the ultimate support of all that is, just like gold is the basis for all gold jewellery. And it is so intimately ours! Abstract the name and shape from the jewellery and the gold becomes obvious. Be free of name and form and of the desires and fears they create, then what remains?

**Q:**&ensp;Nothingness.

**M:**&ensp;Yes, the void remains. But the void is full to the brim. It is the eternal potential just as consciousness is the eternal actual.

**Q:**&ensp;By potential you mean the future?

**M:**&ensp;Past, present and future — they are all there. And infinitely more.

**Q:**&ensp;But since the void is void, it is of little use to us.

**M:**&ensp;How can you say so? Without a breach in continuity how can there be rebirth? Can there be renewal without death? Even the darkness of sleep is refreshing and rejuvenating. Without death, we would have been bogged up forever in eternal senility.

**Q:**&ensp;Is there no such thing as immortality?

**M:**&ensp;When life and death are seen as essential to each other, as two aspects of one being, *that* is immortality. To see the end in the beginning and the beginning in the end is the intimation of eternity. Definitely, immortality is not continuity. Only the process of change continues. Nothing lasts.

**Q:**&ensp;Awareness lasts?

**M:**&ensp;Awareness is not of time. Time exists in consciousness only. Beyond consciousness where are time and space?

**Q:**&ensp;Within the field of your consciousness there is also *your* body.

**M:**&ensp;Of course. But the idea “my body”, as different from other bodies, is not there. To me it is “*a* body”, not “my body”, “*a* mind”, not “my mind”. The mind looks after the body all right, I need not interfere. What needs to be done is being done in the normal and natural way. 

You may not be quite conscious of your physiological functions, but when it comes to thoughts and feelings, desires and fears, you become acutely self-conscious. To me, these too are largely unconscious. I find myself talking to people, or doing things quite correctly and appropriately, without being very much conscious of them. It looks as if I live my physical, waking life automatically, reäcting spontaneously and accurately.

**Q:**&ensp;Does this spontaneous response come as a result of realisation or by training?

**M:**&ensp;Both. Devotion to your goal makes you live a clean and orderly life, given to search for truth and to helping people, and realisation makes noble virtue easy and spontaneous by removing for good the obstacles in the shape of desires and fears and wrong ideas.

**Q:**&ensp;Don’t you have desires and fears any more?

**M:**&ensp;My destiny was to be born a simple man, a commoner, a humble tradesman, with little of formal education. My life was of the common kind, with common desires and fears. When, through my faith in my teacher and obedience to his words, I realised my true being, I left behind my human nature to look after itself until its destiny is exhausted. Occasionally an old reäction, emotional or mental, happens in the mind, but it is at once noticed and discarded. After all, as long as one is burdened with a person, one is exposed to its idiosyncracies and habits.

**Q:**&ensp;Are you not afraid of death?

**M:**&ensp;I am dead already.

**Q:**&ensp;In what sense?

**M:**&ensp;I am double-dead. Not only am I dead to my body, but to my mind as well.

**Q:**&ensp;Well, you do not look dead at all!

**M:**&ensp;That’s what you say! You seem to know my state better than I do!

**Q:**&ensp;Sorry. But I just do not understand. You say you are bodiless and mindless, while I see you very much alive and articulate.

**M:**&ensp;A tremendously complex work is going on all the time in your brain and body — are you conscious of it? Not at all. Yet for an outsider all seems to be going on intelligently and purposefully. Why not admit that one’s entire personal life may sink largely below the threshold of consciousness and yet proceed sanely and smoothly?

**Q:**&ensp;Is it normal?

**M:**&ensp;What is normal? Is your life — obsessed by desires and fears, full of strife and struggle, meaningless and joyless — normal? To be acutely conscious of your body — is it normal? To be torn by feelings, tortured by thoughts — is it normal? A healthy body and a healthy mind live largely unperceived by their owner; only occasionally, through pain or suffering, they call for attention and insight. Why not extend the same to the entire personal life? One can function rightly, responding well and fully to whatever happens, without having to bring it into the focus of awareness. When self-control becomes second nature, awareness shifts its focus to deeper levels of existence and action.

**Q:**&ensp;Don’t you become a robot?

**M:**&ensp;What harm is there in making automatic what is habitual and repetitive? It is automatic anyhow. But when it is also chaotic it causes pain and suffering and calls for attention. The entire purpose of a clean and well-ordered life is to liberate man from the thrall of chaos and the burden of sorrow.

**Q:**&ensp;You seem to be in favour of a computerised life.

**M:**&ensp;What is wrong with a life which is free from problems? Personality is merely a reflection of the real. Why should not the reflection be true to the original as a matter of course, automatically? Need the person have any designs of its own? The life of which it is an expression will guide it. Once you realise that the person is merely a shadow of the reality, but not reality itself, you cease to fret and worry. You agree to be guided from within and life becomes a journey into the unknown.
