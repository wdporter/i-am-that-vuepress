# 67. Experiënce Is Not The Real Thing

>Experiënce, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very nature it comes and goes. Self-realisation is not an acquisition. It is more in the nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost.

**Maharaj:**&ensp;The seeker is he who is in search of himself. Soon he discovers that he cannot be his own body. Once the conviction ‘I am not the body’ becomes so well grounded that he can no longer feel, think and act for and on behalf of the body, he will easily discover that he is the universal beïng, knowing and acting; that in him and through him the entire universe is real, conscious and active. This is the heart of the problem: Either you are body-conscious and a slave of circumstances, or you are the universal consciousness itself — and in full control of every event. 

Yet consciousness, individual or universal, is not my true abode; I am not in it, it is not mine, there is no ‘me’ in it. I am beyond, though it is not easy to explain how one can be neither conscious nor unconscious, but just beyond. I cannot say that I am in God or I am God; God is the universal light and love, the universal witness — I am beyond the universal even.

**Questioner:**&ensp;In that case you are without name and shape. What kind of beïng are you?

**M:**&ensp;I am what I am — neither with form nor formless, neither conscious nor unconscious. I am outside all these categories.

**Q:**&ensp;You are taking the <span data-tippy-content="Not this; not this, the analytic process of progressively negating all names and forms (<em>nama–rupa</em>) of which the world is made in order to arrive at the eternal, Ultimate Truth.">neti-neti</span> (not this, not this) approach.

**M:**&ensp;You cannot find me by mere denial. I am as much everything as nothing. Not both, or either. These definitions apply to the Lord of the Universe, not to me.

**Q:**&ensp;Do you intend to convey that you are just nothing?

**M:**&ensp;Oh, no! I am complete and perfect. I am the beïngness of beïng, the knowingness of knowing, the fullness of happiness. You cannot reduce me to emptiness!

**Q:**&ensp;If you are beyond words, what shall we talk about? Metaphysically speaking, what you say holds together — there is no inner contradiction. But there is no food for me in what you say. It is so completely beyond my urgent needs. When I ask for bread, you give jewels. They are beautiful, no doubt, but I am hungry.

**M:**&ensp;It is not so. I am offering you exactly what you need — awakening. You are not hungry and you need no bread. You need cessation, relinquishing, disentanglement. What you believe you need is not what you need. Your real need I know, not you. You need to return to the state in which I am — your natural state. Anything else you may think of is an illusion and an obstacle. Believe me — you need nothing except to be what you are. You imagine you will increase your value by acquisition. It is like gold imagining that an addition of copper will improve it. Elimination and purification, renunciätion of all that is foreign to your nature is enough. All else is vanity.

**Q:**&ensp;It is easier said than done. A man comes to you with stomach-ache and you advise him to disgorge his stomach. Of course, without the mind there would be no problems. But the mind is there — most tangibly.

**M:**&ensp;It is the mind that tells you that the mind is there. Don’t be deceived. All the endless arguments about the mind are produced by the mind itself, for its own protection, continuätion and expansion. It is the blank refusal to consider the convolutions and convulsions of the mind that can take you beyond it.

**Q:**&ensp;Sir, I am an humble seeker while you are the Supreme Reality itself. Now the seeker approaches the Supreme in order to be enlightened. What does the Supreme do?

**M:**&ensp;Listen to what I continue telling you and do not move away from it. Think of it all the time and of nothing else. Having reached that far, abandon all thoughts, not only of the world, but of yourself also. Stay beyond all thoughts, in silent beïng–awareness. It is not progress, for what you come to is already there in you, waiting for you.

**Q:**&ensp;So you say I should try to stop thinking and stay steady in the idea ‘I am’.

**M:**&ensp;Yes, and whatever thoughts come to you in connection with the ‘I am’, empty them of all meaning, pay them no attention.

**Q:**&ensp;I happen to meet many young people coming from the West and I find that there is a basic difference when I compare them to the Indians. It looks as if their psyche (<span data-tippy-content="The psyche, mind. Mind in a collective sense, including intelligence (<em>buddhi</em>), ego (<em>ahamkara</em>) and mind (<em>manas</em>).">antahkarana</span>) is different. Concepts like Self, Reality, pure mind, universal consciousness — the Indian mind grasps easily. They ring familiar, they taste sweet. The Western mind does not respond or simply rejects them. It concretises and wants to utilise them at once in the service of accepted values. These values are often personal: health, well-beïng, prosperity; sometimes they are social: a better society, a happier life for all; all are connected with worldly problems, personal or impersonal. Another difficulty one comes across quite often in talking with Westerners is that to them everything is experiënce — as they want to experiënce food, drink, women, art and travels, so do they want to experiënce <span data-tippy-content="One of the six systems of the Hindu philosophy (from <em>yoj</em>, to yoke or join). <em>Yoga</em> teaches the means by which the individual spirit (<em>jivatma</em>) can be joined or united with the universal spirit (<em>Paramatma</em>).">yoga</span>, realisation and liberation. To them it is just another experiënce to be had for a price. They imagine such experiënce can be purchased and they bargain about the cost. When one <span data-tippy-content="Spiritual teacher, preceptor.">guru</span> quotes too high in terms of time and effort, they go to another who offers installment terms, apparently very easy, but beset with unfulfillable conditions. It is the old story of not thinking of the grey monkey when taking the medicine! In this case it is ‘not thinking of the world’, ‘abandoning all self-hood’, ‘extinguishing every desire’, ‘becoming perfect celibates’ and so forth. Naturally there is vast cheating goïng on at all levels and the results are nil. Some *guru*s, in sheer desperation, abandon all discipline, prescribe no conditions, advise effortlessness, naturalness, simply living in passive awareness, without any pattern of ‘must’ and ‘must not’. And there are many disciples whose past experiënces brought them to dislike themselves so badly that they just do not want to look at themselves. If they are not disgusted, they are bored. They have excess of self-knowledge; they want something else.

**M:**&ensp;Let them not think of themselves if they do not like it. Let them stay with a *guru*, watch him, think of him. Soon they will experiënce a kind of bliss, quite new, never experiënced before, except maybe in childhood. The experiënce is so unmistakably new that it will attract their attention and creäte interest; once the interest is roused, orderly application will follow.

**Q:**&ensp;These people are very critical and suspicious. They cannot be otherwise, having passed through so much learning and so much disappointment. On one hand they want experiënce, on the other they mistrust it. How to reach them, God alone knows!

**M:**&ensp;True insight and love will reach them.

**Q:**&ensp;When they have some spiritual experiënce, another difficulty arises. They complain that the experiënce does not last, that it comes and goes in a haphazard way. Having got hold of the lollipop, they want to suck it all the time.

**M:**&ensp;Experiënce, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very nature it comes and goes. Self-realisation is not an acquisition. It is more in the nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost. On the other hand, consciousness is changeful, flowing, undergoïng transformation from moment to moment. Do not hold on to consciousness and its contents. Consciousness held, ceases. To try to perpetuate a flash of insight or a burst of happiness is destructive to what it wants to preserve. What comes must go. The permanent is beyond all comings and goïngs. Go to the root of all experiënce, to the sense of beïng. Beyond beïng and not-beïng lies the immensity of the real. Try and try again.

**Q:**&ensp;To try one needs faith.

**M:**&ensp;There must be the desire first. When the desire is strong, the willingness to try will come. You do not need assurance of success when the desire is strong. You are ready to gamble.

**Q:**&ensp;Strong desire, strong faith — it comes to the same. These people do not trust either their parents or society or even themselves. All they touched turned to ashes. Give them one experiënce absolutely genuine, indubitable, beyond the argumentations of the mind and they will follow you to the world’s end.

**M:**&ensp;But I am doïng nothing else! Tirelessly I draw their attention to the one incontrovertible factor — that of beïng. Beïng needs no proofs — it proves all else. If they only go deeply into the fact of beïng and discover the vastness and the glory to which the ‘I am’ is the door, and cross the door and go beyond, their life will be full of happiness and light. Believe me, the effort needed is nothing when compared with the discoveries arrived at.

**Q:**&ensp;What you say is right. But these people have neither confidence nor patience. Even a short effort tires them. It is really pathetic to see them groping blindly and yet unable to hold on to the helping hand. They are such nice people fundamentally, but totally bewildered. I tell them, “You cannot have truth on your own terms. You must accept the conditions”. Some will accept the conditions and some will not. Acceptance or non-acceptance are superficial and accidental but reality is in all; there must be a way for all to tread — with no conditions attached.

**M:**&ensp;There is such a way, open to all, on every level, in every walk of life. Everybody is aware of himself. The deepening and broadening of self-awareness is the royal way. Call it mindfulness, or witnessing, or just attention — it is for all. None is unripe for it and none can fail. 

But, of course, you must not be merely alert. Your mindfulness must include the mind also. Witnessing is primarily awareness of consciousness and its movements.
